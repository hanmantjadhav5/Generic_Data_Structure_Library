# Generic-Data-Structure-Library

1. This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data      
  structures.
  
2. We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental as well as advanced operations on linear, non-linear     data structures in object oriented way.

3. We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.

4. All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
